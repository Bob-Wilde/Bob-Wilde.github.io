            <h4>Project Purpose and Goal</h4>
            <p>
               An e-commerce webpage to enable users to purchase diffrent brands of cars. Has a rating and review section on the card item from other clients. Also has a properties section to enable clients to choose their type of car based on the specific properties presented. 
               Designed a different webpage for the cart section for calculating the items purchased. <br>Has a search box and some brands button which filters the products upon typing in a letter or clicking the button. Also has a login form for new users.
            </p>

            <h4>Web Stack and Explanation</h4>
            <p>Built the architecture using HTML and designed/styled it with CSS. Used JavaScript to add funtionality to the 'Cart' button which adds the product to the cart icon as well as the cart page. Also, on the cart page, JavaScript was used in the calculation of selected products, deleting of a product as well as clearing of all the product from the cart. I also used the browser's local storage to store the items added to the cart as well as deleting or clearing the cart.</p>
